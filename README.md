# Rekhi

Data Scientist & ML Practitioner building toward AI/ML engineering roles.

I code and learn every single day. My long-term goal is building systems that approach genuine machine intelligence.

## Current Focus

**[Data Every Day](https://github.com/Rekhii/Data-Every-Day)** — Daily practice with real-world datasets. ML/DL models on weekdays, LLM fine-tuning on weekends.

**[Machine Learning from Scratch](https://github.com/Rekhii/Machine-Learning)** — Implementing core algorithms (Linear/Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Trees) using only NumPy. Mathematical derivations, convergence analysis, visualizations.

**[Deep Learning from Scratch](https://github.com/Rekhii/Deep-Learning)** — Building neural networks layer by layer. Backpropagation, gradient flow, architecture design.

**[LLM Fine-Tuning](https://github.com/Rekhii/Fine-Tuning-LLM)** — Experiments with BERT, GPT-style models, LoRA/QLoRA, and PEFT techniques.
