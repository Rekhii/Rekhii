# 👋 About Me  

 - Exploring **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement learning & LLMs**  
 - I code & learn every single day, sharing progress here on GitHub  
 - My focus: becoming a strong **AI Engineer** through consistent projects  

---
##  What I’m Working On
- ** Data Every Day** - Daily practice with real-world datasets and ML models — improving skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation.  
- ** Deep Learning from Scratch** - Building neural networks layer by layer, visualizing gradients, and understanding how theory translates into working architectures.  
- ** Fine-Tuning & Custom LLMs** - Weekend experiments with **BERT**, **GPT-style**, and **LoRA-based** models to explore transfer learning and optimization.  
- **🔁 Self-Improving Projects** - Tracking experiments, comparing results, and refining pipelines to build more consistent, reproducible, and scalable AI workflows.
