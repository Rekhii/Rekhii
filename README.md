# 👋 About Me

 - Exploring **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement learning & LLMs**  
 - I code & learn every single day, sharing progress here on GitHub  
 - My focus: becoming a strong **AI Engineer** through consistent projects  

---
##  What I’m Working On
- **Data Every Day** - Daily practice with real-world datasets and ML models — improving skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation.Working on **training and evaluating ML, DL, and      Transformer-based models, focusing on improving data preprocessing, feature selection, and model generalization.
  
-  **Machine Learning from Scratch** — Re-deriving every core ML algorithm (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Trees, etc.)  
  Implementing step-by-step using only **NumPy**, focusing on mathematical clarity, convergence, and visualization.  

- **Deep Learning from Scratch** - Building neural networks layer by layer, visualizing gradients, and understanding how theory translates into working architectures.
  
- **Fine-Tuning and Custom LLMs** - Weekend experiments with **BERT**, **GPT-style**, and **LoRA-based** models to explore transfer learning and optimization.
 
- **Self-Rewriting  AI** - Tracking experiments, comparing results, and refining pipelines to build more consistent, reproducible, and scalable AI workflows.
