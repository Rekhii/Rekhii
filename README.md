👋 Hi, I'm Rekhi

I'm deeply interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning, and I love exploring how intelligent systems can learn, adapt,
and make sense of complex data. 

My work revolves around experimenting with different neural network architectures, optimizing models,
and understanding how data can be used to build smarter, more efficient systems.

I enjoy turning ideas into working models from concept to implementation and constantly learning new techniques that push the boundaries of what’s possible with AI. Whether it’s improving model accuracy,

enhancing training efficiency, or exploring emerging trends in the AI ecosystem, I’m always driven by curiosity and innovation.
